Experimenting with procedural geometry

## Demos

[Random Walk Fractal](https://intrepidolivia.github.io/fractal-practice/randomwalk_index.html)
This fractal starts off very slow. It grows in a similar manner to bacteria. If you leave the screen open for several minutes, you will see its colony slowly develop over time.

[Iterated Function System](https://intrepidolivia.github.io/fractal-practice/iteratedfn_index.html)
Experimenting with "simulated" fractals via the Iterated Function System that several sophisticated fractal visualizers are based off of. (These are not sophisticated, but are serviceable Serpinski-esque visualizations.)
